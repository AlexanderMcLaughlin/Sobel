# Sobel
Uses a less complex non-gaussian convolution and threshold to find edges in an image file

Note: This is a Code blocks project, however the C file will work just fine when compiled like this:

> gcc sobel.c infile.pgm outfile1.pgm outfile2.pgm

The first outfile will show the gradient magnitude of the image, the second will show the actual line trace of the image outline
